# Cart-Track : For a faster shopping experience

### Problem Statement:

One of the problems during shopping is that sometimes we may not get the complete idea of the
product. To get a better understanding about the product, customers may have to ask the
employees. Still we can’t ensure the exact details from employees also. For huge shopping, it's
quite difficult to manually track the budget. If it's crowded, customers may need to wait in a
queue for a long time to make the payment. Keeping a paper bill for the future is also not a good
option. So collectively, customers lose some of their precious time shopping.

### Solution:

Our aim is to create an application that helps in budget tracking and easy payments while
shopping. The product can be added to cart by scanning the QR code on the product. Details of
the product will be available on scanning the QR code. The application automatically computes
the cost of the products in the cart. Scanned details can be used to create an invoice. Adding
and removing items from cart options can easily edit the invoice also. The invoice is directly
saved to the device. It can be of great use to customers as well as the shop owners. Need for
manual labour can be reduced. Direct payment can be made from the app. This can also reduce
the hustle and bustle in the billing area which has to be avoided especially during this pandemic.



### Who are benefitted:

1. Customer:
- Complete details of the product available by just scanning the QR code
- Real time budget tracking possible with ease of adding and removing item from
the virtual cart
- Ease of payment
- No need to wait in a queue for payment.
- Can keep digitised invoice.
2. Shop owner
- Reduces the number of employees.
- Reduces crowd in payment area.
- Need not spend money on accounting softwares.
- Save money by avoiding bill printing machines and papers.
3. Environment
- Reduced usage of papers leads to decrease the amount of cutting trees.
- Reduced usage of machinery leads to decrease in e-waste.

### Technology stack:

#### 1. Android Studio
Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for android
application development. Android Studio provides more features that enhance our productivity
while building Android apps. It provides a unified environment where you can build apps for
Android phones, tablets, Android Wear, Android TV, and Android Auto. Android studio’s job
is to provide the interface for you to create the apps and to handle much of the complicated file
management behind the scenes. The programming language is java, this will be separately on
the machine.
#### 2.XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for
encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The design
goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual
data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design
of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary
data structures such as those used in web services.
#### 3.Java
Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language that is designed to have a few
implementation dependencies as possible. It is a powerful general purpose programming
language intended to let the application developers write once, run anywhere meaning that
7compiled java code can run on any platforms that support java without any need for
recompilation.
#### 4. Firebase Realtime Database
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database in which data is stored as JSON.
The data is synchronized in real-time to every connected client. All of our clients share one
Realtime Database instances and automatically receive updates with the newest data, when we
build cross
platform applications with our iOS, and JavaScript SDKs. It is a NoSQL database from which
we can store and sync the data between our users in real-time. It is a big JSON object which the
developers can manage in real time. Real-time syncing makes it easy for our users to access
their data from any device, be it web or mobile.
